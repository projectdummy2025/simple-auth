DEVELOPMENT PLAN - Simple Authentication Project (Full Docker Approach)

PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP
- [x] Create project directory structure with Docker-first mindset
  - [x] Create root directory
  - [x] Create backend/ directory with src/ subdirectory
  - [x] Create frontend/ directory with src/ subdirectory
- [ ] Initialize git repository (with Docker-friendly .gitignore)
- [ ] Create initial README.md skeleton
- [ ] Create shared .env file for Docker configuration
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml skeleton with all services
- [ ] Create individual Dockerfiles for each service

PHASE 2: BACKEND DEVELOPMENT (Docker-Native)
- [ ] Create backend package.json inside container context
- [ ] Build Express.js application from within Docker container
- [ ] Establish PostgreSQL connection from containerized environment
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication within containerized backend
- [ ] Implement user model/schema with PostgreSQL in mind
- [ ] Develop POST /auth/register endpoint (test within container)
- [ ] Develop POST /auth/login endpoint (test within container)
- [ ] Develop GET /auth/me endpoint (protected, test within container)
- [ ] Implement password hashing functionality (inside container workflow)
- [ ] Create error handling middleware (container-compatible)
- [ ] Test all backend endpoints using containerized environment only
- [ ] Ensure no host machine dependencies for backend development

PHASE 3: FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT (Docker-Native)
- [ ] Initialize Vite React project using containerized Node.js
- [ ] Install frontend dependencies within containerized environment
- [ ] Develop layout/components structure in Docker-first approach
- [ ] Implement Register page/component (in containerized environment)
- [ ] Implement Login page/component (in containerized environment)
- [ ] Implement Protected page/component (in containerized environment)
- [ ] Create API service for backend communication (container-to-container)
- [ ] Implement JWT token handling (in containerized frontend)
- [ ] Add form validation (within containerized development workflow)
- [ ] Ensure all development happens within containers (no local Node.js)

PHASE 4: CONTAINERIZED ARCHITECTURE
- [ ] Finalize backend Dockerfile for production-ready image
- [ ] Finalize frontend Dockerfile for production-ready image
- [ ] Complete docker-compose.yml with all services:
  - [ ] Backend service (with volume mapping for hot reload during dev)
  - [ ] Frontend service (with volume mapping for hot reload during dev)
  - [ ] PostgreSQL database (with persistent volume)
- [ ] Configure all environment variables for Docker environment
- [ ] Set up proper network communication between containers
- [ ] Ensure hot-reload functionality for development in containers

PHASE 5: INTEGRATION TESTING (Container-Based)
- [ ] Test user registration flow end-to-end in containerized environment
- [ ] Test user login flow end-to-end in containerized environment
- [ ] Test protected routes functionality in containerized environment
- [ ] Verify JWT token handling across containers
- [ ] Test container-to-container communication
- [ ] Validate database persistence in containerized PostgreSQL
- [ ] Perform load testing in containerized environment if needed

PHASE 6: DOCUMENTATION
- [ ] Complete README.md emphasizing Docker-first approach:
  - [ ] Project overview
  - [ ] Technology stack (with Docker emphasis)
  - [ ] Prerequisites (Docker and Docker Compose only)
  - [ ] Setup and installation instructions (Docker-focused)
  - [ ] Running the project (docker compose commands)
  - [ ] API endpoint documentation
  - [ ] Environment variables documentation
  - [ ] Development workflow (using containers only)
  - [ ] Troubleshooting container issues
- [ ] Add usage examples for containerized environment

PHASE 7: FINAL VERIFICATION
- [ ] Verify zero runtime dependencies on host machine
- [ ] Confirm complete application runs solely in containers
- [ ] Verify data persistence between container restarts
- [ ] Clean up Docker artifacts and optimize images
- [ ] Verify all PRD requirements are met in containerized environment
- [ ] Document any container-specific known issues or limitations
